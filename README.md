# Music Mixer - Drag and Drop Website

## Overview
Welcome to the Music Mixer, a fun and interactive web application created by Rebin Reji Vazhavilayil. This application allows users to mix different musical instruments and create unique compositions by dragging and dropping icons representing instruments onto designated drop zones. Additionally, users can pause and resume the audio playback.

## Features
- Drag and drop functionality: Users can drag icons representing musical instruments and drop them onto designated drop zones.
- Mix multiple instruments: Users can mix up to six different musical instruments to create unique compositions.
- Audio playback: Each instrument icon corresponds to an audio file, which plays when the icon is dropped onto a drop zone.
- Pause and resume: Users can pause or resume the audio playback at any time using the provided buttons.

## How to Use
1. **Drag and Drop Icons**: Drag the icons representing musical instruments from the top section and drop them onto the designated drop zones below.
2. **Listen to the Composition**: As you drop each icon onto a drop zone, the corresponding audio file will play, allowing you to listen to your composition.
3. **Reset**: To start over, click the "Reset" button. This will clear the drop zones and allow you to mix a new composition.
4. **Pause and Resume**: You can pause the audio playback at any time by clicking the "Pause" button. Clicking the "Pause" button again will resume the playback from where it was paused.
